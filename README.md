# CrispDm_Housing_Price_Prediction_Project
# Full Machine Learning Project in R | Deployed via R Shiny

Overview
This project implements the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to predict housing prices using machine learning algorithms in R. The solution was developed end-to-end â€” from data understanding to deployment â€” and is fully interactive through a R Shiny web application.

The primary goal was to create a robust predictive model that can estimate property prices based on historical sales data and relevant features, enabling better decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts.

Key Features
Full CRISP-DM Workflow:

Business Understanding â€“ Defined objectives and success criteria.

Data Understanding â€“ Explored patterns, trends, and correlations.

Data Preparation â€“ Cleaned, transformed, and engineered features.

Modeling â€“ Trained multiple ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, XGBoost).

Evaluation â€“ Compared models using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

Deployment â€“ Integrated final model into an R Shiny dashboard.

R-based Implementation: Entire pipeline developed in R with packages like caret, ggplot2, randomForest, xgboost, and shiny.

Interactive Shiny App:

Upload custom datasets.

Explore EDA visualizations.

Compare model performance.

Generate real-time housing price predictions.

Deployment
The project is deployed on shinyapps.io for public access.
